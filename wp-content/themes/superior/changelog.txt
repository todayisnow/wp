Info:
Superior 2.0 is not fully backwards compatible with previous versions but ONLY in case of Visual composer elements.

--------- STORY ------------
To be honest - Visual composer issues was main reason why we took down Superior theme from ThemeForest market.
We released Superior just before they updated their plugin to version 4.0 which was highly incompatible with that what was in 3.7.x versions.
We delayed update to 4.0 for few weeks - this how much work and testing it required for us.

Upgrading to 4.0 meant that sites of our clients will look different and probably have broken layout.
We had to merge plugins 3.7 with 4.0 to get consistent look, and to face our clients demand to get newest version of Visual composer with theme.
From that point each update of VC was nightmare, but we kept this under control.
But version 4.3.x was next shift in incompatibilities and changed grid system in builder.

Keeping up to date is not always best way to do things :-)
But we can't explain all above to every customer...

Anyway, now it all looks better with VC, and that is why we do this "not fully compatible Superior 2" version of theme.

Firstly we wanted to remove all our custom elements for builder, but after checking all out, we have removed only problematic ones.
Other we have renamed to "Theme name_of_element" so you should have most of styling intact.
However we advise to not use them if you will face any problems, as they might come in conflict with builder styles.
We also re enabled all Builder elements that we have blocked previously as we didn't like their behaviour.
We believe that user will not use elements that for him/her are looking/working bad:-)
There are also some elements that we have added to builder since first version, and they should work good.


Here is list what we did in topic of builder(Visual composer) elements:
-Removed theme specific styling for Tabs, Tour, Accordion and Faq elements.

-Removed "Button" element in favour to builders "Button" and "Button 2" elements(you will need to replace all removed shortcodes)

-Renamed "Button" to "Theme Button"
-Returned back builders "Button" element

-Renamed "Call to Action Button" to "Theme Call to Action Button"
-Returned back builders "Call to Action Button" element

-Renamed "Progress bar" to "Theme Progress bar"
-Returned back builders "Progress bar" element

-Renamed "Separator" to "Theme Separator"
-Returned back builders "Separator" element

-Removed theme specific settings for Single image

-Removed theme specific settings for vc_posts_grid
-Removed theme specific settings for vc_carousel
-Removed theme specific settings for teasers
-Removed "Recent Posts", "Recent Works", "Recent Galleries". You will have to use "Post grid" or "Post Masonry grid" instead
-Added "work" and "gallery" to post type list in "Post grid" and "Post Masonry grid"
-Added tiny style for "Single image", so it should react better in columns.
---------- END OF STORY ---------

So what you should do now?
-Get new Superior version from ThemeForest
-update VC while updating theme http://apollo13.eu/docs/superior/#!/installation_update_update_theme
-You are done, but remember to activate new builder options http://apollo13.eu/docs/superior/#!/activate_builder_options

Now it would be good if you scan your pages to see if everything is working fine, and correct if there are any problems.

We hope everything will go well!
